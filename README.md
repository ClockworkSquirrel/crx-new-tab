# New Tab by ClockworkSquirrel
A new tab page replacement for Chromium-based browsers.

## Design
New Tab takes inspiration from Google's Material Design language to deliver a beautiful new tab experience. The minimalistic design allows users to jump straight into the action, with handy links to Google services, in addition to a personally curated list of websites.

## Installation
New Tab is currently a work in progress. You can load the extension unpacked via the Chrome Extension Management page's Dev Mode options and selecting the `/build` directory.

Once the first version is complete, the extension will initally be available to download from the Chrome Web Store.
